for any interval [a, b]. By replacing the function f(x) with a suitable polynomial p(x) such that

This is taken to be an approximation of the integral I

Geometrically this is equivalent to replacing the area enclosed by the curve y = f(x) between the ordinates x = a and x = b by that of p(x).

The approximation of _I_ is usually known as _numerical integration_ or _quadrature_.
